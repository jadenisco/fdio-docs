What is FDIO?
=============

FD.io (Fast data - Input/Output) is a collection of several projects and
libraries to amplify the transformation to support flexible, programmable
and composable services on a generic hardware platform. FD.io offers the
Software Defined Infrastructure developer community a landing site with
multiple projects fostering innovations in software-based packet processing
towards the creation of high-throughput, low-latency and resource-efficient
IO services suitable to many architectures (x86, ARM, and PowerPC) and
deployment environments (bare metal, VM, container).

A key component is the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) library donated by Cisco.
