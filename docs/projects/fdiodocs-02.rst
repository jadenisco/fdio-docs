-  **Title:** Create State of the Art Documentation for FDIO
-  **FDIO Description:** (Fast data - Input/Output) is a collection of
   several projects and libraries to amplify the transformation to
   support flexible, programmable and composable services on a generic
   hardware platform. FD.io offers the Software Defined Infrastructure
   developer community a landing site with multiple projects fostering
   innovations in software-based packet processing towards the creation
   of high-throughput, low-latency and resource-efficient IO services
   suitable to many architectures (x86, ARM, and PowerPC) and deployment
   environments (bare metal, VM, container).
-  **Description:** Create state of the art documentation for FDIO.
   However, this is much more than a documentation project. By the end
   of the internship we expect to go live with the new web site. To do
   this we expect the developer to use the current documentation to
   install, build, debug and possibly write a module for FDIO. In the
   process the developer will improve, convert and create complete and
   accurate FDIO documentation. The developer to should spend about 50%
   of his/her time coding and 50% documenting. Depending on the skill
   level and expertise of the developer we expect we can find the
   appropriate place in FDIO to focus on. We will be flexible.
-  **Additional Information:**

-  `FDIO Main Site <https://fd.io>`__
-  `FDIO wiki <https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP>`__

-  **Desirable Skills:** C, Python, Sphinx, readthedocs, git

-  **Expected Outcome:**

-  Go live with the new Website
-  Developer should have written at least 1 module, fixed some issues

-  **Skills Acquired:**

-  Developer will get a great overview of many sections of FDIO
-  Developer will learn to write State of The Documents (an important
   and overlooked skill)
-  Developer will enhance his/her Python, "C" programming skills

-  **Difficulty:** Medium

-  **Mentors:** John Denisco <jdenisco@cisco.com>, Ed Warnicke
